//! Query-driven entity extraction for pack languages.
//!
//! FileAnalysis extraction for a pack language is driven by declarative
//! tree-sitter queries — entities out, procedural state managed by a
//! generic driver + per-language predicates — so the per-language part
//! is DATA (a .scm query pack) rather than a hand-written walker. The
//! core is language-agnostic the way highlights.scm/tags.scm consumers
//! are. See `docs/adr/query-extraction-rings.md` for why this works for
//! ring-1/2 extraction and deliberately does not attempt ring-3 semantic
//! synthesis (that stays per-language: plugins for Perl, pack predicates
//! + the driver's fold contributors for everything else).
//!
//! Architecture:
//!   - `queries/perl/skeleton.scm` — patterns whose CAPTURE NAMES form
//!     a language-neutral entity vocabulary (`@def.*`, `@ref.*`,
//!     `@scope`, `@context.*`, `@import`).
//!   - `LangPack` — the per-language bundle: query source + host
//!     predicates for what patterns can't express (name shaping,
//!     suppression rules). The "back and forth": the driver owns
//!     ordered traversal and state (scope stack, sticky contexts);
//!     the pack answers point questions about text it understands.
//!   - `extract()` — the generic driver. Knows NO Perl: it sorts
//!     capture events, maintains the scope stack and sticky contexts,
//!     and assembles `SkelSymbol`/`SkelRef` rows.
//!
//! Wired into every pack language's `PackDriver` (`language_driver.rs`);
//! `query_extract_tests.rs` also measures it differentially against the
//! real Perl builder as an accuracy net.

/// `Query::new` is expensive (~400ms for the Perl skeleton) and `extract`
/// runs per file, so recompiling every call dominates the workload. A pack's
/// `query_source` is a unique `&'static str`, so its pointer identity keys the
/// compiled query — same pack, same query, one compilation. Leaking the boxed
/// query is bounded (one per language pack) and gives the `&'static Query` the
