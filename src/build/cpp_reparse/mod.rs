//! SPIKE: the C++ reparse seam — macro expansion before extraction.
//!
//! The C++ instance of `docs/prompt-cpp-reparse.md`'s reparse-hook
//! flavor. The obstacle course proved the worst, most common damage is
//! a declarator-position macro: `class API_EXPORT Widget {...}` reparses
//! as a `function_definition`, so the class evaporates. The fix is not
//! clang — it is *expansion*: replace the macro with its body and
//! re-parse. The probe (`dbg_cpp_attr_probe`) showed tree-sitter-cpp
//! handles the real attribute syntax (`__attribute__((...))`,
//! `__declspec(...)`) fine — the macro was merely hiding it. So the
//! transform is generic: **expand to body, let the parser validate.**
//!
//! Two flavors fall out of one pass:
//!   - object-like declarator macros (`API_EXPORT`) — the reparse-hook:
//!     expansion fixes a corrupted parse.
//!   - function-like declaration macros (`DECLARE_DYNAMIC(cls)`) — the
//!     emit-hook outcome achieved BY expansion: the body's member
//!     declarations become real, extractable symbols. Expansion
//!     subsumes the emit-hook for C++ (the doc's bet).
//!
//! Soundness is the stratified seam: this runs strictly upstream of
//! extraction (and of any witness bag), so it never interleaves with a
//! type fixpoint. A `SpliceMap` (transformed byte → original byte, the
//! Zed-anchor idea) carries every recovered span back to user text.
//!
//! Honest scope (measured, not hidden): single source-level pass with
//! pre-expanded bodies. Macros whose expansion itself contains further
//! macro CALLS (X-macros: `COLOR_LIST(X)` → `X(RED) X(GREEN)`) need
//! iterative source passes — out of scope here; that nested tail is
//! exactly the "amortize full cpp to once" case. Deliberately not wired
//! into the build pipeline; measured by `cpp_reparse_tests.rs`.
