//! The typed-edge graph — one walker over what is morally one graph.

//! A DERIVED view, no stored graph. Edges materialize on demand from
//! the stores that already exist (`PackageFacts::parents` ∪ `parents_of`'s
//! synthetic app-surface edge, the `ModuleEdgeIndexes` children map,
//! plugin-namespace bridges); `walk` is the single traversal — seen-
//! set, depth cap, edge-kind mask — that the ancestry/bridge/descendant
//! queries route through. Design: `docs/adr/graph-walking.md`.
//!
//! `GraphView` consumes `&FileAnalysis` + the `CrossFileLookup` trait
//! and answers queries; `FileAnalysis` stays the canonical model (rule
//! #2), and the builder never touches this.
//!
//! Model layer: a derived view over `&FileAnalysis` and the model-
//! defined `CrossFileLookup` trait, with zero Index-layer deps — so the
//! model-internal walkers (`for_each_ancestor_class` and the dispatch/
//! method/bridge resolution that funnels through it) call `walk`
//! directly, no up-layer import.
