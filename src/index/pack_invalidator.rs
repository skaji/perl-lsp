//! The pack-file invalidation subsystem, in ONE home: file change → which
//! pack analyses are stale → re-analyze + swap registrations → which OPEN
//! documents the caller must refresh.
//!
//! `PackInvalidator` owns the three coordination facts that keep concurrent
//! invalidations sound:
//!
//! - the **serialization lock** (did_save + watcher events can race on the
//!   same header; unregister/register swaps must not interleave);
//! - the **bulk-index coordinator** (H9-2): changes arriving while the
//!   initial pack index is still attaching are deferred and reconciled once
//!   at `finish_bulk_index`;
//! - the **source-generation discipline** (H9-1): every swap claims the
//!   changed file's mtime generation, so a stale re-analysis (pre-save
//!   bytes) can never revert a fresher registration.
//!
//! The only mutation entry points are `file_changed` and
//! `finish_bulk_index` (plus the `begin_bulk_index` mark) — the worker that
//! evicts/re-analyzes/swaps is private, so a new invalidation path cannot
//! compile around the lock, the coordinator, or the generation guard.
//!
//! **The consumer rule is spelled once** (`is_consumer`): a consumer is any
//! analysis whose include closure contains the changed path. Both the
//! registered-file re-analysis storm and the open-document refresh set apply
//! it, and BOTH sit behind the surface gate — an Unchanged verdict (body/
//! comment edit in a header) re-analyzes the changed file alone and returns
//! an empty consumer set, open documents included: their analyses are still
//! semantically valid (macro bodies and include directives are ON the
//! surface), so re-gathering them would be pure storm.
//!
//! Lock order: `change_lock` is the subsystem's OUTERMOST lock — acquired
//! only from the entry points with no other lock held. Everything the worker
//! touches (pack index maps, the module-cache connection, the reparse
//! caches) nests strictly beneath it, and the open-document sweep over
//! `FileStore` runs AFTER the guard drops, so `change_lock` never meets a
//! store shard guard.
