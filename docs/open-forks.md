# Open architectural forks — for discussion

Convention (standing order, 2026-07-03): when autonomous work hits a genuine
architectural fork, we (a) pick the LOOSELY-COUPLED option — reversible,
behind a seam, no serialized-format lock-in where avoidable — (b) implement
it, and (c) log the fork here with the options, what was picked, why, and
what undoing it would cost. The user reviews this ledger; entries get
resolved (ratified or reversed) explicitly.

Format per entry:

## <fork name> — <date> — <status: OPEN / ratified / reversed>
- **Context:** where it came up (slice, finding).
- **Options:** A / B (/ C), one line each.
- **Picked:** which, and the loose-coupling story (how it stays undoable).
- **Undo cost:** what reversing takes.
- **Discussion needed:** the question for the user.
