# Cold-start determinism repro (the M6/L3 "LSP session determinism" flake).
#
# Loops a COLD-cache C++ e2e session N times and reports the failure rate.
# The flake it locks down was a DashMap shard-reentrancy DEADLOCK: a request
# handler held a `get_open` read guard across `resolve()`, which re-locks the
# open shards via `for_each_open`; a concurrent diagnostics-refresh
# `for_each_open_mut` writer queuing on that shard (parking_lot writer
# preference) wedged the handler's reentrant read behind the writer, behind the
# handler's own first read. The Perl cpanfile resolver fires a burst of ~45
# refresh callbacks right after `didOpen`, so a mixed repo hit the window
# intermittently; each wedged handler consumed a worker thread until the runtime
# starved and every request timed out (the "5 compute assertions miss, self-heal
# on rerun" symptom).
#
# A flaky deadlock cannot be a gold row (the assertion is stable, the timing is
# not) — this loop is the lock. Pre-fix it fails a fraction of runs (worse under
# load); post-fix it is 0/N.
#
# Usage:  N=20 e2e/cold-start-repro.sh          # N defaults to 20
#         Assumes a `--features all-langs` release build already exists.
