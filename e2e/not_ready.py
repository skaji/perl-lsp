"""Regression net for the not-ready-vs-no-result distinction (raw LSP).

While a document's initial build runs, pull verbs must never answer a
fast `null` — LSP null means "nothing at this position", a FINAL answer
the client caches and never re-requests, which is how a giant file made
the editor look dead until a refresh nudge landed (scaling-limits §6).
The contract under test:

  1. default: a verb fired immediately after didOpen WAITS for the
     in-flight build (the 5 s Interactive floor in `await_open_ready`)
     and answers with content — never null, never an error.
  2. coldWaitMs: 0 (wait opted out): the same verb answers
     ContentModified (-32801) — "in flux, retry" — never null.

Branch 2 is forced via the opt-out rather than a monster fixture: in
default mode -32801 only fires when a build outruns the 5 s floor,
which post the fold fixes means roughly >20k-line files — nothing a
checked-in fixture should be.

This test deliberately has NO readiness gate before the probed request:
firing before the server is ready IS the scenario. The only wait is for
the `initialize` RESPONSE — tower-lsp silently drops notifications sent
before the handshake completes, so a client that fires
initialize+initialized+didOpen back-to-back wedges itself, not the
server. Every request carries a hard deadline so a hang is a loud FAIL,
not a slow pass. `shutdown` is sent WITHOUT params — tower-lsp rejects
`"params": null` with -32602 and the clean exit under assertion never
happens.

Speaks raw LSP over stdio (not nvim) because the assertion is about
message ORDERING relative to the build, which a real client's own
readiness logic would mask. Emits the harness summary line
(`N passed, M failed`) so run.sh sums it like any suite.
