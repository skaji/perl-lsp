# Differential test harness: run the C++ e2e suite against BOTH perl-lsp and
# clangd (the e2e is LSP-agnostic — the LSP binary is chosen by PERL_LSP_BIN,
# and the assertions are protocol-level: goto-def line, references set, rename
# edits, symbols). Categorizes every assertion:
#
#   PARITY   both pass         → standard behavior; also a regression guard
#                               (if WE later fail a PARITY row, we broke something
#                               clangd gets right)
#   OURS     we pass, clangd ✗ → a perl-lsp value-add (macro see-through, our DX
#                               diagnostics) OR a strict-format assertion
#   GAP      clangd passes, we ✗→ a real gap to close (clangd does it, we don't)
#   BOTH✗    neither passes    → fixture needs setup (e.g. clangd wants a
#                               compile_commands.json) or a shared limitation
#
# NOTE clangd is fallback-parsing our small self-contained fixtures (no compile
# DB); multi-file fixtures may not attach for it. That asymmetry is itself a
# data point (build-independence is our lane), not a clangd defect — read GAP
# rows with that in mind.
#
# Usage: ./e2e/compare-clangd.sh            (auto-detects clangd)
#        CLANGD=/path/to/clangd ./e2e/compare-clangd.sh
